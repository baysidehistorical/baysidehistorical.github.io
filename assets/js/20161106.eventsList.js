Known originally as West Flushing, the neighborhood was created before the building boom experienced by Queens in the 20th century. Enchanted by its bucolic landscape, the West Flushing Land Company in the mid-1800s sought to create a suburban residential neighborhood in its midst. The frenzy of development that followed marked the end of Coronas colonial era of farms, dirt roads, and gaslight street lamps, as well as the cherished way of life they signified. Developer Benjamin Hitchcocks groundbreaking installment-plan system put Corona on the map for good in 1870; its founding would set a precedent for future neighboring communities like Forest Hills and Jackson Heights. Before New Yorkers came to the area for Mets baseball and the US Open, people flocked to the National Race Course, one of the first complexes of its kind in America, for an exciting day at the races, while the Tiffany Glass Company forged distinctive lamps and glassware in its Corona-based factory.</p><p><i>This program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.</i><br><img src='assets/images/logo/bhs_sm.png' height='30px'/> <img src='assets/images/logo/dca.png' height='30px'/> </p> "
